== Features

* Manage https://github.com/joohoi/acme-dns[acme-dns] (https://github.com/acme-dns/acme-dns[[2\]]) domain registrations and txt record updates with ease
* Supports https://certbot.eff.org/[certbot]
* Supports https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh[acme.sh]
* One configuration for all: command line, certbot, acme.sh, etc.
** Allows switching between Let's Encrypt clients (certbot, acme.sh) without reconfiguration
* All details of each registration is kept in files to reduce command line parameters and support multiple acme-dns server instances
* Scripts only: Python 3.5+ with wrapper shell script (POSIX compatible) for handling Python Virtual Environment
////
* Prepared for future acme-dns functionalities
** deregister a domain
** clean/remove a domain's token/txt record
** change domain registration details (e.g. allowfrom)
////


== Installation

Project page: {url-project}

=== Prerequisites

Install Python 3 (3.5+) and Virtual Environment support via venv.

Debian/Ubuntu: `apt install python3 python3-venv`

=== acme-dns-client-2

Download {url-project}[acme-dns-client-2] and extract it to a temporary directory.
Or directly `git clone` it to a temporary directory. +
Make `install.sh` executable.
Run it to install acme-dns-client-2 to `${PREFIX]/usr/local/bin`. `${PREFIX]` is useful for package maintainers of Linux distros. +
It will also create an initial configuration file and initial domain accounts file in `${PREFIX]/etc/acme-dns-client`.
```
chmod u+x install.sh
PREFIX='' ./install.sh
```

=== acme.sh Support
Copy `dns_acmednsclient2.sh` to `/path/to/acme.sh/dnsapi/`.


== Usage

=== Running acme-dns-client-2

Always execute `acme-dns-client-2.sh`.
It is a wrapper shell script to create and activate the required Python Virtual Environment. +
When executed without any arguments it will display the main help with the possible commands.

==== For developers/admins
`acme-dns-client-2.py` can be run directly but the required modules must be available either from the system or an activated Python Virtual Environment.
That allows to debug the Python script with an IDE.

=== Commands List

```
usage: acme-dns-client-2.sh [-h] [--config CONFIG] [--accounts ACCOUNTS] [--verbose] command ...

options:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  --config CONFIG      path to configuration file
  --accounts ACCOUNTS  path to domain accounts file
  --verbose, -v        increase verbosity

commands:
  command              Use `<command> --help` for details
    add                add an already registered domain (to client only)
    certbot            run as manual-auth-hook with certbot
    check              check DNS setup of a registered domain
    config             list configuration
    list               list registered domains
    register           register a domain
    remove             remove a registered domain (from client only)
    rename             rename a registered domain
    show               show data for a registered domain
    update             update challenge token of a registered domain
    version            show program version
```

=== Configuration File

The configuration file defaults to `/etc/acme-dns-client/config.json`.
An alternative config file can be defined via `--config`.
Maintain config file manually to define other values.

See the current configuration in JSON syntax via `acme-dns-client-2.sh config`.
If the config file is missing/empty, then the defaults are shown.

The following can be configured in JSON syntax:

* `default_server` (string) - defines a default server to use for `add/register` command. +
Useful if mainly a single acme-dns server is used.
Still another acme-dns server can be specified via `--server`.
* `nameservers` (list of strings) - define different name servers to do DNS lookups via their IPs.
* `accountspath` (string) - defines a different domain accounts file. Professional use only.

=== Domain Accounts File

The domain accounts file defaults to `/etc/acme-dns-client/domain_accounts.json`.
An alternative domain accounts file can be defined via `--accounts` or via config file. +
It holds all details of the registered domains in JSON syntax. +
*DO NOT* maintain it manually.

* Use command `acme-dns-client-2.sh list` to get all registered domain names.
* Use command `acme-dns-client-2.sh show --domain <domain>` to show details for a domain.

=== Register/Add Domain

Register/Add each domain separately. +
If a domain was already registered earlier and the related data is available, then use `add`.
The password must be known as it cannot be determined from anything else.
The fulldomain can be determined from the DNS CNAME record of the related challenge domain.
The subdomain is part of the fulldomain.
The username can be de determined from the acme-dns database record for the subdomain. +
Otherwise `register` anew.
Warning! This will lead to a new DNS setup, that will break other setups.

A single registration is needed for normal and wildcard certificate entries of a domain, e.g. `test.example.com` is also valid for `*.test.example.com`.

Note: `--server` can be omitted if `default_server` is defined in configuration and fits the domain registration.

==== Register a new domain

```
acme-dns-client-2.sh register \
  --domain 'test.example.com' --server 'https://acme-dns.example.net'
```

==== Add an already registered domain

```
acme-dns-client-2.sh add \
  --domain 'test.example.com' --fulldomain 'a1a1a1a1-b2b2-c3c3-d4d4-e5e5e5e5e5e5.acme-dns.example.net' --username '<USERNAME>' --password '<PASSWORD>' --server 'https://acme-dns.example.net'
```

=== Check Domain Setup

Use command `acme-dns-client-2.sh check --domain <domain>` to check the setup for a domain. +
It checks the DNS CNAME record for the domain and if TXT records are delivered for it.

If the setup shall be monitored during the setup procedure, then use shell command `watch -n 10 \-- acme-dns-client-2.sh ...`.

=== certbot Usage

Tested certbot version: 2.11.0

After registration of the domains on the acme-dns server and checking their setup, request a certificate with certbot on the command line as following:
```
certbot certonly [--test-cert] \
  --manual --preferred-challenges dns \
  --manual-auth-hook '/usr/local/bin/acme-dns-client-2.sh certbot' \
  -d 'test.example.com' \
  -d '*.test.example.com' \
  ...
```
or via a certbot configuration file: `certbot ... --config <file> ...`
```
...
authenticator = manual
preferred-challenges = dns
manual-auth-hook = /usr/local/bin/acme-dns-client-2.sh certbot
...
```
Afterwards no special parameters are needed:
```
certbot renew [---force-renewal] \
  --cert-name 'test.example.com' \
  ...
```
```
certbot revoke \
  --cert-name 'test.example.com' \
  ...
```
https://eff-certbot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[Certbot Documentation] -> "User Guide"

=== acme.sh Usage

Tested acme.sh version: 3.0.7

After registration of the domains on the acme-dns server and checking their setup, request a certificate with acme.sh as following:
```
acme.sh --issue [--server letsencrypt_test] \
  --domain 'test.example.com' --dns dns_acmednsclient2 \
  --domain '*.test.example.com' --dns dns_acmednsclient2 \
  ...
```
Do *NOT* define any domain alias.

Afterwards no special parameters are needed:
```
acme.sh --renew [--server letsencrypt_test] -d 'test.example.com'
```
```
acme.sh --revoke [--server letsencrypt_test] -d 'test.example.com'
```

== Development & Testing

=== certbot Testing

Forcing execution of the manual-auth-hook script can be achieved by doing a `--dry-run` since certbot 0.40.
```
certbot certonly/renew --dry-run ...
```

=== acme.sh Testing

Forcing execution of the DNS API script can be achieved by clearing the "valid" status of a domain at Let's Encrypt via the `--deactivate` command.
Wildcard domains have their own status, so these have to be deactivated separately.
```
acme.sh --deactivate [--server letsencrypt_test] -d 'test.example.com' -d '*.test.example.com'
```

Enabling debug output can be done via `--debug 1`. Levels 2 and 3 are even more verbose. Use `--debug 2` for bug reports. +
Warning! Using `--output-insecure` is only recommended for private tests.
Do not post any output/log where this option was enabled.


== Alternative Clients

* https://github.com/acme-dns/acme-dns-client[acme-dns-client] by joohoi (written in Go)
** Similar domain accounts file `/etc/letsencrypt/acmedns.json`, which can be directly used with acme-dns-client-2 (either copy or use `--accounts`).
* Coding example only! https://github.com/joohoi/acme-dns-certbot-joohoi[acme-dns-certbot] by joohoi (written in Python)
** This was the reason acme-dns-client-2 was created.
* https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh/blob/master/dnsapi/dns_acmedns.sh[dns_acmedns.sh] (https://github.com/dampfklon/acme.sh[[2\]]) (acme.sh shell script)
** only works for certificates with a single domain (normal and/or wildcard).
